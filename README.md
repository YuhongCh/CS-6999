# CS-6999

This is my CS 6999 Project Repository for my MSCS study in Georgia Institute of Technology.
The goal of this project is to implement the papers: 
- [libWetHair: A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Hair Interactions](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/liquidhair/) 
- [libWetCloth: A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Fabric Interactions](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/wetcloth/)

The implementation will be completed based on Taichi.
