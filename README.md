# CS-6999

This is my CS 6999 Project Repository for my MSCS study in Georgia Institute of Technology.
The goal of this project is to implement the papers: 
- [libWetHair: A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Hair Interactions](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/liquidhair/) 
- [libWetCloth: A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Fabric Interactions](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/wetcloth/)

The implementation will be completed based on Taichi.

Since Taichi requires a clear distinction between Taichi-Scope and Python-Scope. 
I decided to name functions with `t_` at start for Taichi-Scope function and `p_` at start for Python-Scope function.
